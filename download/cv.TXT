**My main goal**
--------------------
Learn new skills in the profession of a WEB developer and become a real specialist in your field. I like to learn new things and get great pleasure from solving interesting and difficult problems. There is no programmer in my environment and I have no one to ask questions of interest, so I independently search for information of interest in various sources and I think that whoever is looking will always find it!
> Even in the company of two people, I will certainly find something to learn from them. I will try to imitate their merits, and I will learn from their shortcomings.

**My preferences**
--------------------
 For content markup, I prefer to use * flex-technology * using * BEM methodology *. From the IDE, I prefer * Visual Studio Code *, which is very happy. To work with layouts, I recently used * Avocode *, but I recently mastered the Figma resource and I'm very happy about that. On my laptop I use the Linux operating system (Ubuntu), because it's interesting, because I constantly face tasks that require solutions, which fuels my interest in learning Linux console commands.

 **My experience**
--------------------
My experience is still modest, but there are already small achievements. So, for example, I have experience in layout * one-page * sites, I constantly watch videos on layout of PSD layouts and immediately practice on educational layouts. I designed my first website for a taxi company, which I made for my friend. I also made a small information site with a registration form for my company, where I am currently working. I attach links:
